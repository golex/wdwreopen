In addition, we currently plan to open the following Disney Resort hotels to booked Guests on the following dates. Please note that the reopening dates have been revised for Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort and Disney’s Art of Animation Resort.

While reopening dates were previously shared for Disney’s Beach Club Resort and Disney’s BoardWalk Inn, these Disney Resort hotels will remain closed until further notice, as the reopening timeline continues to be reevaluated.

Future reopening dates are subject to change and Guests’ reservations could still be modified to other Disney Resort hotels if needed.

Given the current situation, there are some Disney Resort hotels and other areas that are not, as of this time, being scheduled for reopening yet. We will continue to evaluate the situation and reopen more locations when the environment is right to do so.

We will continue to monitor the constantly changing environment and its impact on the state of Florida as we find the right time to welcome back even more of our Guests and Cast Members.

We continue to assist Guests with current hotel reservations for 2020, modifying travel plans as needed.

Additionally, Disney’s Hilton Head Island Resort and Disney's Vero Beach Resort are now open to Members and Guests. Please note that some of the details below may not apply to Disney’s Hilton Head Island Resort and Disney’s Vero Beach Resort.
